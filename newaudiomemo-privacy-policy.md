**Your Privacy is Important to Us**

At NewAudioMemo, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting the data you create and use within our app. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we handle, how we use it, and how we keep it secure.

### 1. Information We Collect
NewAudioMemo does **not collect, store, or share any personal information**. The only data created and managed by the app are the audio recordings you create.

All recordings are stored locally on your device and optionally in iCloud, which allows you to sync them across your Apple devices. We do not have access to your recordings or any data synced with iCloud.

### 2. Use of iCloud
NewAudioMemo offers integration with **iCloud** for your convenience. If you choose to use iCloud, your audio recordings are stored in your iCloud account. This data is managed by **Apple**, and NewAudioMemo does not store, transmit, or have access to this information. To learn more about how Apple protects iCloud data, please refer to Apple’s [iCloud Privacy Overview](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/icloud.html).

### 4. User Control and Data Rights
- **Your Data**: All data recorded using NewAudioMemo belongs to you. You have complete control over your recordings.
- **Deleting Data**: You can delete your recordings at any time directly from within the app. If iCloud is enabled, deleting recordings in NewAudioMemo will also remove them from iCloud.

### 5. Security
We take reasonable steps to ensure that your data remains secure. All recordings are saved locally on your device or securely in iCloud. We recommend enabling device-level security, such as a passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID, to further protect your recordings.
